## Easy server restarts

One thing you will find is that you will need to restart Express JS everytine you changed a source file to get around that, install [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon). This will restart Express JS whenever a source file changes.

It's here : https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon - install it using npm

Use it like this:

```
nodemon server.js
```

Go ahead and setup nodemon.
